While making this portfolio, I focused on keeping it basic and clean to showcase my work in a simple manner. I removed the logo that was in the header of the mockup I made since it didn't translate smoothly from the desktop into mobile. I chose to use it as a browser tab icon instead. Mostly everything was straightforward, but I did run into some problems. An issue I encountered was setting up the contact form to have the messages sent directly to my email. I couldn’t find a solution directly in HTML or CSS. I ended up finding a simple solution by using a form backend and email service called “FormSubmit”. All I needed to do was add the "form action=“https://formsubmit.co/myemail”" syntax to the form I previously made. This sends the customer’s message directly into my email inbox. 

An important thing I learned while making this portfolio, was to initially focus on device compatibility and optimization right when I start. While creating this portfolio, I initially spent my time making the website compatible with Flexbox and CSS grid on all devices. This made my life way easier when I began to add images, colours and any additional features to the portfolio.
